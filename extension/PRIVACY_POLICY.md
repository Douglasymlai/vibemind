# Privacy Policy for Vibe Mind Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025

## Introduction

Vibe Mind ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a Chrome extension that helps enhance prompts for AI coding platforms using OpenAI's vision API. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### User-Provided Information
- **OpenAI API Key**: You provide your own OpenAI API key, which is stored locally in your browser's Chrome storage.
- **Prompt Content**: Text and images you choose to analyze through the extension.

### Automatically Collected Information
- **None**: We do not automatically collect any personal information, analytics, or usage data.

## How We Store Your Information

### Local Storage (Your Device)
- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key is stored exclusively in Chrome's local storage on your device. It never leaves your device except when making API calls to OpenAI.
- **Recent Results**: Analysis results may be temporarily cached in local storage for your convenience.

### Our Servers
- **Processing Only**: When you use the extension, your requests are processed through our backend server (hosted on Railway) solely for the purpose of coordinating the API call to OpenAI.
- **No Persistent Storage**: We do not store, log, or retain your prompts, images, API keys, or analysis results on our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

Your information is used solely for:
1. **Authenticating with OpenAI**: Your API key authenticates requests to OpenAI's API
2. **Processing Requests**: Text and images are sent to OpenAI for analysis
3. **Returning Results**: Analysis results are returned to you through the extension

We do NOT:
- ❌ Store your data on our servers
- ❌ Share your data with third parties (except OpenAI for processing)
- ❌ Use your data for marketing
- ❌ Sell or rent your data
- ❌ Track your usage patterns
